# synchronization

A few simple experiments with synchronization mechanisms such as mutex and lock.

This projects contains two different targets:
* Target "mutex" is a plain C program and will be used to demonstrate using mutex in C
* Target "synchronization" uses C++ and will be used to demonstrate C++ features for synchronization

## Switching Targets in VSCode

To switch the target in VSCode, click on the CMake extension (icon with triangle and wrench) and select the target that you want to build/launch.
